## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-21

Sender identities, mobile updates & general UI/UX tweaks for readability, spacing, fonts etc.

Sender identities: lets you define a sender profile (name, one-or-more domains incl. their subdomains, optional HTTPS logo URL, per-sender remote-image trust). Shown as logos in place of monograms via a new SenderAvatar component, managed in a new "Senders" settings tab, with "Always allow" buttons in both the desktop and mobile readers. Backed by new lib/sender.ts policy code, contract/preferences additions (senderProfiles), and a new sender-check.mjs wired into dev.sh check.

Mobile compose screen: a new full-screen MobileComposer (replaces the docked composer on mobile), plus a useKeyboardInset hook so the keyboard never covers the send bar. Recipient parsing was hoisted into a shared parseAddrs used by both composers; mobile row layout was reworked (sender/subject/date on separate lines).

Small UI/UX tweaks: reader header drops the "to/cc" line and gets tighter padding; sidebar header/account-count removed and group icons now tinted via icon fill; empty-state typography restyled; a --danger button variant added.
